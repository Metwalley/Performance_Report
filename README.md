## Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning was performed using Power Query, ensuring a detailed and automated record of applied transformations. Key steps include:

### **General Actions:**
1. **Data Type Adjustments**: Converted columns to appropriate data types multiple times during the process.
2. **Column Operations**: Split columns by delimiter, added new columns, renamed columns, and removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
3. **Row Filtering and Error Handling**: Removed blank rows, filtered unwanted rows based on specific criteria, and handled or removed errors for better accuracy.
4. **New Column Additions**: Introduced calculated columns to enrich the dataset and enhance analytical insights.
5. **Column Renaming**: Renamed columns to improve clarity and consistency in the data.
6. **Step-by-Step Transformations**: Recorded and re-recorded changes such as adding, removing, renaming, and splitting columns iteratively as new insights were discovered.

These steps ensured the data was cleaned efficiently and systematically, maintaining a clear record of all applied transformations for reproducibility and transparency.
